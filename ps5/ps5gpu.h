/* ps5gpu - a small GPU layer for PS5 homebrew built as a real title by ps5link.
 *
 * This is the reusable distillation of the bring-up work in
 * PS5SDK/tools/ps5link (clear_test.c, mesh_test.c, tex_test.c,
 * mesh_tex_test.c, mesh_depth_test.c), each of which proved one piece on
 * hardware. See the project_ps5link_gpu_render memory for how each register
 * value was arrived at - most of them were expensive to find.
 *
 * It offers exactly one shader pair: textured geometry multiplied by a
 * per-vertex colour. That is not a limitation of taste but of tooling - there
 * is no PSSL compiler here, so shaders are precompiled binaries lifted from
 * elsewhere. That one combination happens to cover most of what a renderer
 * like SM64's asks for.
 *
 * Unlike the bring-up tests, which recorded one draw per frame, this records
 * many draws with changing state, so it keeps a per-frame arena in
 * graphics-visible memory and emits register updates between draws.
